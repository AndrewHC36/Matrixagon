# TheEndlessWorld
A game heavily-inspired by the world.terrain generation of Minecraft and other Minecraft
mods using Rust's Vulkan Wrapper (Vulkano) to construct the game.

### General
This game is a world.block-based game similiar to Minecraft, but prioritize on world.block 
simulation but with added minimal gameplay. But when we say minimal gameplay, it 
means there are no crafting, enchanting, and alike. Though there are inventory
systems and world.player effects.

It specializes in realistic and fantastical world.terrain generation, world.weather systems,
machine learning entities, and other components. And hopefully a total modularized
systems with everything customizable from world.player commands to internal render meshes.

And please do consider this as a game, and not a serious simulation.

### Development Status
This game is still heavily in development. Check [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

Also, please do check this weekly. We'll be updating the game weekly at minimum.
